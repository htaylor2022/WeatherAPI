# WeatherAPI

Written in Python (3.6.5)

This program connects to OpenWeatherMap's API, and displays the name, weather, temperature, and humidity of a given city.

There are no required pre-requisites for this program aside from your API key, which you can obtain after creating an account here: https://openweathermap.org/

The API key provided in the source has been deactivated, and is used as an example for other users. Please make sure to input your own API key where the current one is.
